The program is just to compile under python3, once compiled at runtime it is necessary to enter the number of particles that the detection system will study and the results are output as a txt file, and curve for the histogram of the influence of small angles and pulses with their associated error bar.

The code can study the influence of an angle on the detectors and thus the influence on the angular distribution of theta and phi.

The code can study the count rate as a function of the distance between the detectors

For the display in 3 dimensions it is necessary to choose which trajectory to go and recover by changing the number of the particle to trace. It is necessary to check beforehand that the particle does not leave the system since the data only keeps the hits of the particles that do not leave.

The code makes a simulation of a cosmic electron pulse spectrometer, the pulses are kept in an output data file with their associated uncertainties.
